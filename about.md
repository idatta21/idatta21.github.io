There is no end to gaining knowledge and no age where one should stop learning. It is the
journey for knowledge that excites me and not the destination.
Mathematics and Statistics have interested me all my life and my way of thinking. I think
mathematics is a most interesting subject. It is amazing that a series of simple numeric characters
represent most of the problems in the world. I fell in love with mathematics when I was a young
pupil, I selected the right formula and did some simple computational processes and I arrived at
the correct answer.
Statistics as a subject is needed in order to analyze, organize and research data. I can
use statistics to work out and analyze if a proposal is going to be successful or not.
Mathematics is another reason why I am so interested in Statistics. If pure math is abstract,
statistics is much closer to our life.
When I have free time, I like to spend time with my family. I have two kids. My daughter is 9 yrs old 
and boy is 14 months old. I also love spent time planting vegetables, flowers and home decor.
Being a stay at home Mom, I have demonstrated the transferable skills of Multi-tasking,
Research, Communication, Organization, Managing people, Negotiation and collaboration. I
believe these skills will enable me to succeed in the Masterâ€™s Program. 

I am really looking forward to Graduate from Master of Statistics Program in the prestigious
institution like North Carolina State University to develop and apply my knowledge in the field
of academic and industry.
