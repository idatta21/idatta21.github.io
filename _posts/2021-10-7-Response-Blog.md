### explaining what I did in the project and any interesting findings
 This is the first time ,I am doing any project where I need to interact with API. I am working with COVID19API.
 Since the DATA's are updating everyday, it is interesting to see my graphs are changing everyday.
### reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:
 – The most difficult part of the logic and programming for me is to make a requirement or what I should analysis and how I am going to implement it.
 Moreover make a function userfriendly and generalized is the difficult portion for me. 
 
 – In,future, First I will sketch a project outline like what are the things is going to discuss or what are the data I should fetch from API,whta are the data
 exploration we should do etc.
