## Outline of Project2
 This Project is about [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) where we are 
 predicting our response variable Shares . We are trying to predict number of shares by fitting our model using Classification and 
 Regression methods. In the given data set, there are number of attributes: 61 (58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 1 goal field).
 We analyzed some of the predictors to find it's contribution to get more  number of shares by doing some summarize ,contingency table and
 graphical representations.
 I like to thank my project partner  [Victoria Seng](https://vic-95.github.io/) for her all the valuable inputs and guiding me throughout 
 the project.

### Reflection
-  Overall process of doing this project was smooth experience for me. Thanks to Victoria Seng.  I like to experiment and spend more time for 
   graphical presenation in future. I like to learn more about selecting  predictors with some known methods and wants to do it programmetically 
   rather just comparing all pairwise correlation coefficients.
  
-  The most difficult part for me was automation ,secondly selecting predictors for the models and merging conflict in git through R. 

-  Big take-aways from this project is I learned how to create multiple report with one single.Rmd file and also colaboration with partner through
   Github.I like to learn more about selecting predictors for a model with more programmetical approach.
