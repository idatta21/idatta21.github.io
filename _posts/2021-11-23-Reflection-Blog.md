what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do

Overall, my perception about Data Scientist and what they do  have not change much . But many aspects of what they actually do and 
how they do have changed. It is better to say that the procedures/algorithms are more clear to me when they use for data cleaning , 
processing, modelling ,predictions and so on. 

what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

Unfortunately before learning R , I had to use R in my previous coures which gave me an impression of R is not that good and I was struggling 
in coding .But after Learning R , it's uses with GitHub,shinyApp,connecting with different kind of databases and making reports in different 
formats with loads of packaages ,functions etc..  make me feel more comfortable with R now. I definitely use R in future whenever I will get 
chance to do so. 

what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

 I am planning to make some future projects where I need to connect with APIs data which I learned through R and Github.
 I am currently looking for internship/job too, so hopefully I can use R there as main statistical language.
