## Outline of Project2

## Reflection
• what would you do differently?
  Overall process of doing this project is good for me. But I like to experiment and spend more time for graphical presenation
  in future. I like to learn more about selecting  predictors and wants to do it differently rather just comparing all pairwise
  correlation coefficiens.t
  
• what was the most difficult part for you?
  First thing is automation and secondly selecting predictors for the models . 

• what are your big take-aways from this project?
  Learn how to create multiple report with one single.Rmd file and also colaboration with project partner through Github.I like to
  learn more about selecting predictors for a model with more constructive approach.
